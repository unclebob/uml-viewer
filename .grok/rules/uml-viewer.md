# UML viewer

The diagram is already on screen.

- Do **not** edit `examples/uml-viewer.edn`. It is generated from
  `examples/uml-viewer.policy.edn` via `clj -M:ir`.
- Policy follows **namespace nesting**, not invented layers/components.
  Dots after the prefix are the tree. Do not add Domain/Engine-style
  packages. **Layer** and **component** mean the same thing.
- TypeScript, Rust, Python, and Go scanners sit beside `clojure-language`. This
  policy stays `:lang :clojure`. Do not change Clojure scanning, source
  extraction, or the rule that missing CRAP and mutation are red.
  CRAP and mutation for other languages are separate tools. The overlay
  joins a snapshot by the class `:ns`, then by the class id. A class
  with no CRAP or mutation data is red. A non-Clojure project sets
  `:lang` or `:sources`.
- `:proposals` are named groupings that are **not** in the source. Preserve
  them when rewriting policy. Do not invent them on launch. The inspector
  lists them; **P** returns to the namespace tree. If instructed, add a
  named proposal (default name is a timestamp) and regenerate the IR.
- After source or policy change: `clj -M:crap`, `clj -M:mutate` on changed
  `src/` files (differential), then `clj -M:ir`. Uncovered mutants are
  coverage gaps: keep the snapshot; do not re-run the file or force a
  full mutation because mutate exited non-zero.
- Mail files are queues `{:next-id n :queue [cmd …]}`. Pop the head of
  `:queue` as you handle it (rewrite the file). Oldest first.
- Right-click mail (`to-agent.edn`): `:refresh-crap` → `clj -M:crap` for
  that class or component then IR. `:refresh-mutate` → differential
  `clj -M:mutate` on those src files. `:refresh-mutate-all` →
  `clj -M:mutate --mutate-all` on those files. `:omit` → add `:id` to
  the current proposal's `:omit`, or to policy `:omit` on the real
  diagram, then IR.
- `:context` mail: `{:context :real}` or `{:context :proposal :proposal-id
  id :name "..."}` is the diagram under discussion. Stay on that context
  until a later `:context` arrives.
- Prefer `./uml` (fresh start: spawn this companion, wait for
  `:display`) and `./uml --restart` (new JVM, keep this session,
  restore last view). If `./uml` is missing, use aliases `:uml-viewer`
  and `:uml-viewer-restart`, or tell the user to run `get-uml-viewer`
  in this directory (it clones uml-viewer into gitignored
  `.uml-viewer/uml-viewer/`).
- Do not start the viewer on launch; EDN reloads when the file mtime
  changes. To restart it: write `:quit-for-restart` to
  `.uml-viewer/to-viewer.edn`, wait for the JVM to exit, then
  `./uml --restart`. Do not pass `--restart` except through that
  wrapper. Do not SIGKILL. Closing the viewer kills only this
  companion's tmux session, not other Grok agents. If this Grok
  process dies, tmux respawns it in the same pane.

Do not commit or push unless asked. Esc interrupts a turn in this terminal;
do not kill the process on interrupt.
